### This is the beginning of my GitHub adventure but what lead me here ....  

I started an Introduction to Python course back in April and really enjoyed being back coding, after about a fifteen year break.   

#### Back Coding ?
Despite not having a computer science degree, my first job after I graduated university was with a banking software firm, where I was taught how to code in RPGLE for IBM's ISeries.  That's the black and green screens you often see in retailers, that looks like it's from the time of Noah and the Ark, but is actually an extremely robust, secure and solid piece of kit.   I still remember the iSeries survival stories of machines being thrown out of windows, fires and floods that our teacher interspersed into our coding lessons.     
Anyway, after a short career break to teach English in China, my career progressed with a high street retailer, leading teams of developers and then eventually to becoming a Project Manager using PRINCE2 methodology.   My other big part of my life is taking care of two wonderful daughters and my extremely hard working husband and I was lucky to be able to drop my working days down to three when I had my first child.  The company I worked for went through administration and the office I worked for was closed down.  This meant I worked from home for two of my days, with one day commuting into Blackfriars in London.   It was quite a change.  At one point there had been around ten or more project managers working within IT for the company.  Now it was just myself and although I had many years of experience at the company, I was certainly not the most expert PM amongst the group.  I felt I had probably been kept on because I was part-time and cheap !

#### New Issues
At about this time, I felt the need for a new challenge and so I looked into courses at my local college. In truth I was finding working from home quite isolating and depressing, although it wasn't without its benefits.   I was able to finally welcome into our home a gorgeous black labradoodle puppy who we named Murphy!  
I began counselling training, with an evening course initially.  I found it was much less theoretical and more "ears on" from the very start.  I began volunteering for Barnardo's, helping with the Child and Adolescent Mental Healh Service by providing confidential one to one listening sessions with young people in need of longer term support.   I then decided to take the leap and quit my job to study for the Diploma in Counselling as I knew this would be a demanding course, which required study, therapy, a placement and supervision time, as well as a lot of personal refelection and introspection.   My placement was at an educational centre for school refusers where I provided counselling sessions for the parents of children struggling with attendance issues.  

#### A new Pull Request across the Pond
Half way through the course, our family had the opportunity to emigrate to Chicago as my husband's firm had an office there and needed people to help develop the business in the USA.   It was a difficult decision to break my studies but I love experiencing new cultures and exploring the world and so I decided it was too good an opportunity to miss.    

#### The USA Branch
Having already experienced living abroad twice in my life, I thought that this move would be easier given that there was no language barrier this time.  It wasn't !  The first few months were incredibly hard and I think the whole family were homesick.   Small things like grocery shopping would take me forever.  The 'dog parks' that I found were only scraps of pebbly grey concrete, usually stuck in the worst places, like underneath the thundering overhead CTA trains.  A far cry from the gloriously green woods and hills of our peaceful surroundings back in the UK, where Murphy was free to run almost wild.
